Set Up Your Environment

Use a Python IDE like VS Code, PyCharm, or simply run the script from the terminal.
Ensure your webcam is connected and functioning properly.
Steps to Run the Code
Save the Script

Copy the code into a Python file, for example: air_drawing.py.
Run the Script

Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where air_drawing.py is saved.
Run the script using:
bash
Copy code
python air_drawing.py
Using the Application

Once the script starts, the webcam feed will open in a window titled "Air Drawing".

How to Use the Features
1. Drawing with Your Finger
Use your index finger to draw on the screen.

2. Erasing with an Open Palm
To erase part of the canvas, show your open palm in front of the camera.
The script will detect the open palm and erase a circular area wherever you move it.
You can adjust the erase radius in the code (erase_radius = 50) to increase or decrease the size of the eraser.
3. Clearing the Entire Canvas

python
Copy code
erase_radius = 50
Adjust Detection Thresholds

Change the minimum detection confidence for hand landmarks:
python
Copy code
